The file nginx_mail_proxy_auth.ru, once set executable (chmod +x), may be run anywhere.  Nginx will be able to communicate with this authentication service for its mail proxy module.

As this is just an example, it is recommended to re-implement the auth method to actually do authentication against a source of information about your mail platform.  For example, by using LDAP:

    require 'net/ldap'

    def auth( user, pass )
      ldap = Net::LDAP.new( :host => @ldapserver )
      filter = Net::LDAP::Filter.eq( "uid", "#{user}" ) | Net::LDAP::Filter.eq( "mail", "#{user}" )
      res = ldap.bind_as(:filter => filter, :base => @base, :password => pass)
      @mailhost ||= res.first[:mailhost]
      res && res.first[:uid]
    end

Try it out and see how it goes.
